This code creates a new Telegram bot using the provided TOKEN and checks all 
incoming messages in the chat specified by CHAT_ID for the 10 specific words 
listed in the WORDS list. If any of the words are found in a message, 
the bot sends an alert to the specified chat using the send_message method.

You will need to replace the YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and YOUR_CHAT_ID placeholders 
with your own bot token and chat ID. Also, make sure you have the python-telegram-bot 
library installed before running the code (pip install python-telegram-bot).
